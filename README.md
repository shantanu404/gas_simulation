Gas particles simulator
=======================

A particular friend of mine asked me if I could build a gas particle simulator.
I usually make simulations in python but obviously python is gonna freak out with
about a thousand particles being rendered and updated on a 60Hz monitor.

So I decided to make it using rust!

note: I recommend using `cargo run --release`. It will make the program way smoother.
